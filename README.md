# Aura
Aura is an intelligent backend sentinel designed to bridge the gap between static local logic and real-world environmental data. Serving as the centralized "brain" for the Momentum ecosystem, Aura transitions from simple file storage to a robust Relational Database (SQLite) and a high-performance FastAPI web server.  The project focuses on Context-Aware Automation: it monitors live external telemetry—such as localized weather and global news via REST APIs—to dynamically influence task prioritization logic. By implementing a background "Watcher" system and professional-grade API endpoints, Aura transforms isolated scripts into a scalable, production-ready infrastructure capable of making autonomous scheduling decisions based on the world around it.
